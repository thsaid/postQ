Test of the hypothesis that 4 factors are sufficient.

The degrees of freedom for the null model are  21  and the objective function was  5.86 with Chi Square of  2078.66
The degrees of freedom for the model are -1  and the objective function was  0 

The root mean square of the residuals (RMSR) is  0 
The df corrected root mean square of the residuals is  NA 

The harmonic number of observations is  359 with the empirical chi square  0.01  with prob <  NA 
The total number of observations was  359  with Likelihood Chi Square =  0.3  with prob <  NA
